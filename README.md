# 💻 Alise McNiel | Tech Portfolio

👋🏾 I'm an IT tech and hands-on builder with a passion for embedded systems, smart automation, and cybersecurity. I use ESP32, Arduino, and C++ to bring my ideas to life — from touchscreen hacking tools to home automation dashboards. Below are my featured projects built from the ground up, with a strong focus on real-world usability, creativity, and clean engineering.

# 🤖 NEPTUNE AI – Local Voice-Driven Web Assistant

NEPTUNE is a hybrid offline/online personal assistant with a dark-mode browser interface, voice recognition, and AI-powered responses. Designed to automate workflows, interact with sensors, and eventually control hardware — NEPTUNE is your local JARVIS in the making.

---

## ✅ What We Built

* ✅ **Flask backend server (`neptune.py`)** for OpenAI/Groq communication
* ✅ **Speech-to-text** using SpeechRecognition + PyAudio
* ✅ **Voice output** using pyttsx3 and ElevenLabs premium voice models
* ✅ **Mic-to-response bridge** (`bridge_neptune_voice_eleven.py`) for real-time flow
* ✅ Animated **dark-themed web UI** with glowing input, dropdown provider switch
* ✅ Built-in `/ask` endpoint for command handling
* ✅ App runs at `localhost:5000` with full CORS enabled
* ✅ Designed for automation 

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Flask, Python 3.10, dotenv, requests, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* SpeechRecognition, PyAudio
* pyttsx3 / ElevenLabs (TTS)
* Selenium + PyAutoGUI (job app automation)

---

## 🧠 How to Run NEPTUNE

```bash
# Step 1: Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv neptune-venv
source neptune-venv/bin/activate

# Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Run the assistant
python3 neptune.py
```

🔑 Notes:

* Requires working mic permissions on Linux
* ElevenLabs API key required for premium voice
* Groq requires `choices` field in response JSON

📸 *Dark mode UI screenshots, glowing avatar states, and video demo in progress*
